# About Project

Your customers are working at Cogent Labs in Roppongi, and are always having trouble picking what to eat for lunch. They would like to
have a web app service which can help them pick a restaurant close to the office. Sometimes they will be tipped off about an awesome
restaurant, so they would also like to be able to do a keyword search for restaurants in the area. Lots of pictures and reviews about the
restaurant help a lot while deciding a new restaurant.

## Technical choices, including architectural

-This project built with React.js with TypeScript.

-Also the Material UI was used as a theme.

-Using the Cypress to test the project.

### Problem

-Couldn't see the clear map because my api key doesn't enable billing.

-The Foursqure api doesn't support menu for free user.
